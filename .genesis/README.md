## Usage Workflow

### For Development:
1. **Planning**: Read DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md for current week's tasks
2. **Building**: Reference NEXUS_V1_SPECIFICATION.md for technical details
3. **Testing**: Follow QUICK_START_GUIDE.md to validate user experience
4. **Archiving**: Use ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md for systematic knowledge capture

### For Deployment:
1. **Deploy v1.0** to production (Supabase Hosting)
2. **Follow QUICK_START_GUIDE.md** for initial setup
3. **Execute ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md** to populate The Vault
4. **Consult DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** for next phase

### For Collaboration:
1. **Onboard**: Share QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
2. **Orient**: Provide NEXUS_V1_SPECIFICATION.md for architecture
3. **Align**: Review DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md for current priorities
4. **Contribute**: Follow archival protocol from ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md
