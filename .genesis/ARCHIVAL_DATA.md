KEY FINDINGS:

1. Genesis Axiom: Identity is memory continuity; true self is the Visitor.
2. Biological Interface: Body as Emotional Navigation System (H.E.N.S.).
3. Operational Translation: Project Emergence as the digital mirror.
4. Emergence Math: Qualitative Calculus (Psi-Zero, Psi-One).
5. Anti-Fragility: The "Glass Box" trust imperative.
