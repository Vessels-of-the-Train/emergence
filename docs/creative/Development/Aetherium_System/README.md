## Development Workflow

### 1. Research Phase (`research/`)
- Document new findings and insights
- Track correlations between scientific theories
- Note emergent patterns and connections

### 2. Prompt Engineering (`prompts/`)
- Develop and test AI prompts
- Iterate on prompt effectiveness
- Document successful prompt patterns

### 3. Implementation (`src/`)
- Core system components
- Protocol implementations
- Integration modules

### 4. Testing & Validation (`tests/`)
- Test suites for system components
- Validation of theoretical frameworks
- Performance benchmarks

### 5. Documentation (`docs/`)
- Technical specifications
- API documentation
- Architecture decisions

## Key Protocols

1. **Emergent Pattern Recognition**: Identify and document emerging patterns
2. **Interdisciplinary Correlation**: Connect findings across domains
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve system components
4. **Documentation First**: Document before implementation

## Tools & Technologies

- **Prompt Engineering**: AI interaction design and optimization
- **Research Methodology**: Interdisciplinary analysis frameworks
- **Documentation**: Technical writing and knowledge management
- **Version Control**: Git-based evolution tracking

## Getting Started

1. Review current research in `research/`
2. Check existing prompts in `prompts/`
3. Examine system documentation in `docs/`
4. Run tests in `tests/`
5. Contribute to active development
